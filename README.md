# NetBaires Architecture Event - Unit Testing Workshop

In this workshop we reviewed the principles behind Unit Testing through hands-on excercises.
We've learned how to test constructors, methods, functions and colaboration among objects.
We've also seen how to take advantage of tools like FakeItEasy for creating mocks.
